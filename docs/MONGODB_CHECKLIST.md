# MongoDB Migration Completion Checklist

## Overview

The migration from SQLite to MongoDB has been completed. This document serves as a final checklist to ensure everything is working properly before considering the migration complete.

## MongoDB Components

- [x] MongoDB connection configuration
- [x] MongoDB models for all entities
- [x] MongoDB route handlers for all API endpoints
- [x] Authentication system adapted for MongoDB
- [x] Data migration scripts from SQLite to MongoDB
- [x] Test scripts for MongoDB connectivity and integration

## Testing Checklist

Before going to production, verify the following:

- [ ] Run basic connection test: `npm run test:mongodb`
- [ ] Run integration tests: `npm run test:mongodb:integration`
- [ ] Test data migration: `npm run migrate:to-mongodb`
- [ ] Verify API responses with MongoDB backend
- [ ] Test frontend functionality with MongoDB backend
- [ ] Check authentication flow with MongoDB
- [ ] Verify file uploads with MongoDB

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Set up MongoDB Atlas cluster (see MONGODB_ATLAS_SETUP.md)
- [ ] Configure environment variables for production (DB_TYPE=mongodb)
- [ ] Set up MongoDB connection string in production environment
- [ ] Deploy backend to Render or other cloud provider
- [ ] Test production deployment

## Post-Migration Tasks

- [ ] Monitor application performance
- [ ] Set up database backups
- [ ] Configure MongoDB Atlas alerts
- [ ] Document any MongoDB-specific features or limitations
- [ ] Update development team on new MongoDB workflow

## Rollback Plan

If issues are encountered with MongoDB in production:

1. Set DB_TYPE=sqlite in environment variables
2. Restart the application
3. The application will revert to using SQLite

## Future Enhancements

Once the MongoDB migration is stable, consider these improvements:

1. Remove SQLite dependency entirely
2. Implement MongoDB aggregation pipelines for advanced reporting
3. Set up MongoDB Atlas data visualization
4. Implement database sharding for scalability
5. Add automated MongoDB performance monitoring

## MongoDB Tips for Developers

- Use MongoDB Compass for database visualization
- Install MongoDB locally for development
- Learn MongoDB aggregation framework
- Use MongoDB Atlas free tier for personal testing
- Keep indexes optimized for performance
