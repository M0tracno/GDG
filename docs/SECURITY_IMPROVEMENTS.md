# Security Improvements - June 3, 2025

## Overview

This document outlines security improvements implemented to address vulnerabilities in the API endpoints. These changes enhance the system's security posture by restricting access to sensitive debugging information and limiting exposed data in public-facing endpoints.

## Implemented Security Fixes

### 1. Protected Debug Routes

Debug routes have been secured with authentication and role-based access control:
- `/debug-routes` - Now requires admin authentication
- `/api/debug-config` - Now requires admin authentication

Additionally, these debug routes are now disabled in production environments through environment-based configuration.

```javascript
// Only available in non-production environments
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  app.get('/debug-routes', auth, roleAuth(['admin']), (req, res) => {
    // Route implementation
  });
}
```

### 2. Limited Health Check Information

The public health check endpoint now exposes minimal information:

```javascript
router.get('/', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    await sequelize.authenticate();
    res.status(200).json({
      status: 'healthy',
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  } catch (error) {
    res.status(500).json({
      status: 'unhealthy',
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  }
});
```

### 3. Added Secure Health Check for Admins

A new detailed health check endpoint has been added that requires admin authentication:
- `/api/health-check/detailed` - Provides full system details for authorized administrators

## Setting Up for Different Environments

### Development Environment

In development, debug routes are available but still protected by authentication:
```
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Production Environment

In production, debug routes are completely disabled:
```
NODE_ENV=production
```

## Additional Security Recommendations

For further security enhancements, consider:

1. Implementing HTTPS with proper certificate management
2. Adding Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
3. Setting up regular security audits
4. Implementing IP-based blocking for repeated authentication failures
5. Using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for additional protection

## Testing

After implementing these changes, verify that:

1. Debug routes are not accessible without authentication
2. Debug routes return 404 in production environments
3. The public health check endpoint only shows minimal information
4. The detailed health check endpoint requires admin authentication
