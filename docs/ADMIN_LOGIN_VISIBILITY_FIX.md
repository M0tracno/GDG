# Admin Login Visibility Fix - Complete ✅

## Problem Description
The admin login page had visibility issues where form fields and text were not visible to users. The text appeared to be blending with the background or had insufficient contrast.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was caused by insufficient contrast between the text colors and background:
1. **Low opacity text colors** - Using `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7)` made text too faint
2. **Insufficient background opacity** - Background `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)` was too transparent
3. **Missing text styling** - Lack of proper `!important` declarations and fallback styles

## Solution Applied

### 1. Enhanced Text Visibility
**Email Field:**
- Increased label opacity from `0.7` to `0.9` with `!important`
- Enhanced input text color to `#ffffff !important` with `fontWeight: 500`
- Added proper placeholder styling with `0.6` opacity
- Improved border visibility with `0.4` opacity

**Password Field:**
- Applied identical styling improvements as email field
- Enhanced icon visibility from `0.7` to `0.9` opacity
- Added comprehensive styling with `!important` declarations

### 2. Improved Background Contrast
- Increased field background opacity from `0.1` to `0.15`
- Enhanced hover state background to `0.2`
- Improved focused state background to `0.25`
- Strengthened border opacity from `0.2` to `0.3`

### 3. Enhanced Form States
- **Hover State**: Better visual feedback with `translateY(-2px)` and enhanced shadows
- **Focus State**: Stronger visual distinction with white labels and enhanced backgrounds
- **Icon States**: Improved visibility for email, lock, and visibility toggle icons

## Technical Implementation

### Key Style Changes Applied:
```css
'& .MuiInputLabel-root': {
  color: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9) !important',
  fontWeight: 500,
  '&.Mui-focused': {
    color: '#ffffff !important',
  },
  '&.MuiFormLabel-filled': {
    color: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9) !important',
  }
},
'& .MuiOutlinedInput-input': {
  color: '#ffffff !important',
  fontWeight: 500,
  '&::placeholder': {
    color: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6) !important',
  }
},
'& .MuiOutlinedInput-notchedOutline': {
  borderColor: 'rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4) !important',
}
```

### PowerShell Command Fix
Also resolved the command execution issue:
- **Problem**: Used `&&` operator which is invalid in PowerShell
- **Solution**: Used separate commands or `;` for PowerShell compatibility
