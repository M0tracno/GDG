# Code Fixes Summary

This document summarizes the fixes made to address ESLint errors and other issues in the codebase.

## 1. Fixed Import Paths

Fixed incorrect import paths for mockApiService.js in these files:
- `src/services/courseAllocationService.js`
- `src/services/messagingService.js`

The issue was that these files were using `../../utils/mockApiService` which falls outside of the project src/ directory. We changed them to `../utils/mockApiService`.

## 2. React Hooks Rules Fixes

Fixed React Hook rule violations in the following login pages:
- `src/pages/StudentLogin.js`
- `src/pages/FacultyLogin.js`
- `src/pages/AdminLogin.js`
- `src/pages/ParentLogin.js`

The issue was that the `useLoginFormStyles` hook was being called at the top level instead of inside the React component. We moved these hooks to be called inside their respective component functions.

## 3. Hook Naming Fixed in Firebase Service

Fixed a function named `useDemoMode` in `src/utils/firebaseConfigService.js` that was not a React Hook but was named like one. We renamed it to `isDemoMode` to avoid confusion with React Hook naming conventions.

## 4. Import Ordering Issues Fixed

Fixed import ordering in multiple components, ensuring that all imports are at the top of the file and properly ordered:
- `src/components/admin/BulkAssignmentDialog.js`
- `src/components/admin/CourseAllocationDashboard.js`
- `src/components/faculty/FacultyFeedback.js`
- `src/components/student/Quizzes.js`
- `src/components/student/StudentAttendance.js`

We also removed empty semicolons and properly organized the import statements.

## Verification

All fixes were verified with a custom verification script that ensures:
- Import paths are correct
- React Hooks are used properly inside components
- The renamed function in firebaseConfigService.js is correct
- Import ordering in all components is fixed

The verification script is available at `verify-fixes.js`.

## Next Steps

To prevent these issues in the future:
1. Use ESLint pre-commit hooks to catch issues before they're committed
2. Add CI pipeline checks for linting
3. Consider implementing stricter ESLint rules for imports and React Hooks
